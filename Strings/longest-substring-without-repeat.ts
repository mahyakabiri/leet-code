/* 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces */

function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    let maxLength: number = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i< s.length;i++){
        let substring = s[i];
        let j = i + 1;
        while(j < s.length){
          if(!substring.includes(s[j])){
            substring = substring + s[j];
            j++;
          } else {
            j = s.length;
          }
        }
        if(substring.length >= maxLength){
            maxLength = substring.length;
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
};

console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring('abcabcbb'));
